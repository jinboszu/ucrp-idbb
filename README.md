**Description:**

This project is part of the paper [Jin, B. & Tanaka, S. (2023). An exact algorithm for the unrestricted container relocation problem with new lower bounds and dominance rules. [*European Journal of Operational Research*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2022.04.006), 304(2), 494–514].

This project is written in C99.

**Remark on the name of the JZW heuristic:**

The **JZW** heuristic, originally developed in **J**in, **Z**hu, & **L**im (2015), could technically have been named **JZL** based on the authors’ surnames’ initials. However, Tricoire, Scagnetti, & Beham (2018) and Feillet, Parragh, & Tricoire (2019) opted to use the name **JZW**, with ‘**J**’ from the first author Bo **J**in’s surname, and ‘**Z**’ and ‘**W**’ from the second author **W**enbin **Z**hu’s surname and given name. In this project, we adhere to this naming convention to avoid confusion among readers.
